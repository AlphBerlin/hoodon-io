This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms and constitutes a binding part of this agreement.

While we employ industry-standard security measures and prioritize User anonymity, you expressly acknowledge and understand that no online service can guarantee absolute privacy or security. The transmission of information over the internet inherently involves risks, and while we implement reasonable security measures, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to or from our Service.

## 8. Payment Terms and Processing

HoodOn.io partners with established payment processors, including but not limited to Stripe, PayPal, and Apple Pay, to facilitate secure transactions on our Service. Each payment processor maintains its own terms of service and privacy policy, which you agree to be bound by when utilizing their services through our platform. We reserve the right to modify available payment processors at any time and in any jurisdiction.

By initiating a purchase or subscription through our Service, you expressly authorize us and our payment processors to charge the applicable fees to your designated payment method. For subscription services, you authorize recurring periodic charges until such time as you cancel the subscription. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any payment method(s) you provide in connection with your account.

All payments must be made in the currency specified for your region. While we strive to display prices in local currencies where available, exchange rates are determined by our payment processors and may fluctuate. Pricing may vary by region, platform, or other factors, and we reserve the right to change our prices at any time without notice. All fees and charges are non-refundable unless expressly stated otherwise or required by applicable law.

## 9. Digital Content and Hood Ownership

When you purchase a Hood or other digital content through our Service, you are acquiring a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use such content within the Service in accordance with these Terms. HoodOn.io retains all right, title, and interest in and to all Hoods and digital content, including all associated intellectual property rights.

We reserve the absolute right to modify, replace, or remove any Hood or digital content at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to technical issues, legal compliance requirements, policy violations, or business decisions.

## 10. Dispute Resolution

Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including the formation, interpretation, breach, termination, or validity thereof ("Dispute"), shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. These procedures constitute your sole remedy in connection with any Dispute arising under or relating to these Terms.

Prior to initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding, you agree to first contact HoodOn.io at support@hoodon.io with a detailed written description of the Dispute and your proposed resolution. Both parties agree to engage in good faith negotiations for a minimum period of thirty (30) days following the submission of the Dispute description (the "Cooling-Off Period"). Most concerns can be resolved quickly and amicably through such informal means.

If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations during the Cooling-Off Period, either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims. All claims arising under or relating to these Terms will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in [Your City] in accordance with the [Selected Arbitration Body] rules, which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, mutually selected by the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be appointed by the [Selected Arbitration Body]. The arbitration shall be conducted in English, and all documents submitted in connection with the proceedings shall be in English or accompanied by a certified English translation.

YOU AND HOODON.IO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

## 11. Platform Safety and User Protection

HoodOn.io implements comprehensive safety measures to protect our user community, but we cannot guarantee absolute security or prevention of all harmful conduct. Users acknowledge that online interactions carry inherent risks and agree to exercise appropriate caution in all platform activities.

We maintain automated systems and human moderation teams that monitor platform activity for potential safety concerns. These systems may automatically flag or restrict content or accounts that appear to violate our safety policies. While we strive for accuracy in these systems, you acknowledge that automated systems may occasionally make errors, and you agree that HoodOn.io shall not be liable for any damages resulting from such errors.

Users are strictly prohibited from engaging in any conduct that threatens the safety or wellbeing of others, including but not limited to: harassment, stalking, impersonation, exploitation, sharing of personal information without consent, or attempting to circumvent our safety features. Violations of these safety requirements may result in immediate account termination and potential referral to law enforcement authorities.

## 12. Limitation of Liability and Disclaimers

High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended for optimal use of the Service. You are solely responsible for acquiring and maintaining all required equipment, software, and services necessary to access and use the Service.

The Service may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.

HoodOn.io reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease, and you must discontinue all use of the Service.

All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## 16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms and your use of the Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in [Your Jurisdiction], and you hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein.

## 17. General Provisions

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and HoodOn.io regarding your use of the Service and supersede any prior agreements between you and HoodOn.io relating to your use of the Service. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by these Terms.
