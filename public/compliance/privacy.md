Last Updated: January 05, 2025

## Introduction
At HoodOn.io ("we," "our," or "us"), protecting your privacy is paramount to our operations. This Privacy Policy outlines our comprehensive approach to collecting, using, disclosing, and safeguarding your information when you use our application and services. We have designed this policy to be transparent about our practices and to ensure you understand your rights and choices regarding your personal information. This policy is applicable to users who are 16 years of age or older, as our services are exclusively intended for this age group.

## Age Restrictions and Verification
Our Service is strictly intended for users who are 16 years of age or older. We maintain this age restriction to ensure compliance with international privacy regulations and to protect young individuals' privacy rights. We implement age verification measures during the registration process and actively monitor for potential underage usage. Should we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from anyone under 16 years of age, we will take immediate action to delete such information from our systems. We encourage parents and guardians to contact us at support@hoodon.io if they believe we may have collected information from a minor under their care.

## Information Collection and Usage
Our information collection practices are designed to gather only the data necessary to provide and improve our services while respecting your privacy rights. We collect information through direct user input and automated technical processes.

### Personal Information Collection
When you use our Service, we collect information that you provide directly to us. This includes your email address, which serves as a primary means of communication and account identification. We also collect profile information that you choose to share, such as your preferences and settings. Location data is collected only with your explicit permission and can be disabled at any time through your device settings. We generate and collect device identifiers to maintain service security and prevent fraud. Usage data helps us understand how our Service is utilized and allows us to make improvements to enhance your experience.

### Automated Information Collection
Our systems automatically collect certain technical information when you access our Service. This includes your IP address, which helps us maintain service security and provide location-based features. We record your browser type and version to ensure optimal compatibility and performance. Information about your device and operating system allows us to optimize our Service for your specific configuration. Time zone settings enable us to provide time-sensitive features accurately. We analyze usage patterns to improve our Service and enhance user experience.

## Advertising and Analytics
We integrate advertising into our Service to support our operations and provide free or reduced-cost access to our features. Our advertising framework is designed with user privacy in mind while maintaining effective monetization.

### Advertising Practices
We collaborate with carefully selected third-party advertising partners to deliver relevant advertisements. These partnerships operate under strict data protection agreements that safeguard your privacy. Our advertising partners may collect and process information about your interactions with advertisements, including viewing patterns and ad response behaviors. This information helps create more relevant advertising experiences while respecting privacy boundaries.

You maintain control over personalized advertising through multiple mechanisms. You can adjust your device settings to limit ad tracking, use industry-standard opt-out tools provided by our advertising partners, or contact us directly to manage your advertising preferences. We honor these choices and ensure they are communicated to our advertising partners.

### Analytics Implementation
Our analytics infrastructure helps us understand how users interact with our Service, enabling us to make informed improvements. We collect data about feature usage, performance metrics, and system stability. This information is processed to identify trends and patterns that guide our development decisions. Analytics data is handled with appropriate security measures and, where possible, is anonymized or pseudonymized to protect user privacy.
